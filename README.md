# FG-Effect-Builder
Extension for Fantasy Grounds which assists in creating effects

To access the Effect Builder type `/buildeffect` or `/effectbuilder` into the chat box.
After your effect string is fully constructed you may copy & paste or drag & drop the string wherever you need it.

By default this extension does nothing, and requires plugins to proved Effect Editors.
