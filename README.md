# FG-Effect-Builder
Extension for Fantasy Grounds which assists in creating effects

To access the Effect Builder type `/buildeffect` or `/effectbuilder` into the chat box.
After your effect string is fully constructed you may copy & paste or drag & drop the string wherever you need it.

Currently the builder supports a very limited subset of D&D 3.5 / Pathfinder effects. (The same ones as the Advanced Effects extension for that ruleset.)
